# 0001. Serve stdio, streamable HTTP and SSE from one command line

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-09-19
- **Deciders:** maintainer

## Context

The gateway spoke stdio (a client spawns the process, nothing listens)
and, since 0.0.2, an authenticated streamable HTTP transport of its own
(`--transport http`, `http/transport.py`: a static dev-mode bearer token
or OAuth 2.1 resource-server auth, `X-MCP-Tenant` scoping) for shared
multi-tenant deployments. That transport carries this server's auth
model and flags; the rest of the suite had no HTTP listener at all. A
gateway that fans one server out to many agents, or an auditor such as
scout that speaks HTTP, needs the same command line on every server.
The MCP specification now has two current revisions on the HTTP
binding, `2025-11-25` (an `initialize` handshake and a session header)
and `2026-07-28` (stateless, per-request `_meta`, `server/discover`),
and clients on either must be served. The older HTTP+SSE transport
(`2024-11-05`) is still what some hosts expect.

The sub-servers this gateway orchestrates are unaffected: it spawns them
over stdio and pools the sessions whatever transport the outer agent
uses.

## Options considered

1. Stay on stdio plus the authenticated `http` transport and leave the
   suite-wide command line to a wrapper process.
2. Add HTTP behind a bespoke module per server, each with its own flags.
3. One shared module, copied verbatim into every server of the suite,
   that maps the same three flags onto the SDK's transports.

## Decision

Option 3. `iso20022-readiness-suite-mcp` runs stdio;
`iso20022-readiness-suite-mcp --transport streamable-http` listens on
`--host`/`--port` at `/mcp` and speaks both current protocol revisions
on that one endpoint, streaming responses as server-sent events and
offering the server-to-client stream on `GET`;
`iso20022-readiness-suite-mcp --transport sse` serves the older
HTTP+SSE transport at `/sse` and `/messages/`. The module binds
loopback unless told otherwise and adds no authentication of its own:
a routable deployment sits behind a gateway the operator trusts. The
authenticated `--transport http` with `--bind` stays as it was, an
additional choice on the same command line.

## Consequences

`main()` keeps its argparse parser and takes `--host`/`--port` from
`_cli.add_arguments`, dispatching the two new choices through
`_transports.run`; both files are the same in every server, so the suite
is started, documented and tested the same way. The server is verified
over streamable HTTP with scout in both protocol eras and over SSE with
the SDK client before release; the conformance workflow lists tools over
every transport. The stdio and `http` tests stay as they were.
